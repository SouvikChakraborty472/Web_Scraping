# Web Scraping of TimesJob

Welcome to the Web Scraping of TimesJob repository! This project demonstrates the complete workflow of web scraping, data cleaning, data wrangling, and data analysis using Python. The primary focus is on scraping job listings from the TimesJob website and transforming the raw data into valuable insights.

## Overview

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook named `Web_Scraping_of_timesjob.ipynb`, which provides a comprehensive guide on how to scrape job data from the TimesJob website. The notebook covers the following key aspects:

1. **Introduction to Web Scraping**: Understand the basics of web scraping and its applications.
2. **Using Beautiful Soup and Requests**: Learn how to use Beautiful Soup and Requests libraries to scrape data from websites.
3. **Data Collection**: Extract raw data of new job openings from the TimesJob website.
4. **Data Cleaning and Wrangling**: Clean and preprocess the scraped data to make it suitable for analysis.
5. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Generate visual insights from the cleaned dataset.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Step-by-step guide to scrape job listings from TimesJob using Beautiful Soup and Requests.
- **Data Cleaning**: Techniques to clean and preprocess the scraped data.
- **Data Wrangling**: Methods to transform and organize data for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Insights and visualizations derived from the job listings dataset.

## Dependencies

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

- BeautifulSoup4
- Requests
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

These dependencies are required to scrape the data, clean it, and visualize the results.

## Usage

The notebook is structured in a way that each section builds upon the previous one. Follow the notebook sequentially to understand the entire process of web scraping and data analysis. By the end of the notebook, you will have a dataset of job listings from TimesJob and visual insights derived from it.
